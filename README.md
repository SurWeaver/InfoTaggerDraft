I am developing an application to store different kinds of content (images, text, links), organizing everything with tags (one-dimensional list as well as tag hierarchy).

The web is unreliable, and it seems local data feels more reliable than the cloud that we so avidly move content to.
Also one of the issues is search. Memorizing a few keywords is better and easier than memorizing an exact sequence of words.

So far it's all in the process of developing an idea and developing a draft (or rather a prototype).

The plan is to do:
* a tag system;
* a resource system (that binds to created tags or can exist freely from it (maybe));
* some importers to grab stuff from web nicely (maybe some targeted imports from sites like coub.com or something like that, we need to heal search systems of these sites);
* different approaches to contain all info locally (platform independed would be cool);
* a lot of ui;
* the swag app.
